# FSharp Demos

Not meant to be anything special, just a repo for fsharp demos in visual studio.

Had the idea for this after a workshop session on functional programming by Scott Wlaschin (@ScottWlaschin) @ #ProgNET15 (02/07/15). In that session Scott went through the basics of functional programming using his own examples and exercises. This repo is my own take on that to further my learning and to (hopefully) help others.
